#The Project

*bonk.io* is an online web-based multiplayer game whereby four players verse each other in a competition to hit each other off the screen.
Each player can design and customise a “skin” (a design for their avatar) for themselves.

The project purpose is to have a website that is a user contributed database of bonk.io skins that users can create, share, and vote on to have a community of creators in a functioning and dynamic website.
Users will use an in-site skin editor with a drag and drop interface that is then saved to a central database as a post, which can be voted up by other users and climb rankings over time.
